  <h1 class="subpage">about</h1>
  <!-- <h2 class="subpage">past</h2> -->
    <p class="subpage">I graduated from the University of Oxford in July 2020, having completed my degree in Engineering Science. My first two years consisted of general Engineering and covered topics from structures to combustion engines to microelectronics, giving me a strong theoretical background across all Engineering disciplines.</p>

    <p class="subpage">In my final year, I undertook a Master's project at the Oxford Robotics Institute as a part of the Soft Robotics Laboratory. We used an industry-standard robotic arm fitted with a robotic skin to identify geometrically similar but materially different objects. More information about this can be found <a href="masters.html" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.

    <p class="subpage">My project, combined with my courses, has given me a strong background and keen interest for both robotics and machine learning that I hope to take forward into my career.

    <p class="subpage">More recently, I have been honing my coding skills in python and javascript as well as learning some html/css. These small projects have mainly focused on short animations and games, and some of them can be found on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page. Every piece of pixel art on this site has been designed my myself, allowing me to express both by love of good design as well as the joy that comes with coding.
